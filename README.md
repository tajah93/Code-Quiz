# Code-Quiz

## Overview ##

The task was to create a timed quiz using JavaScript fundamentals. Once the user reaches the page, they will begin their quiz to finish in the alloted time (the time left can be seen in the bottom left-hand corner). Whenever they are done, they will press the "Submit Quiz" button. After the button is pressed, they will then be able to see the questions they have gotten wrong (depicted in red) and the ones they have gotten correct (depicted in green). They will also see their score in the bottom left-hand corner. They will then be instructed to click the "Score" button, which will prompt them to insert their score and initials.
